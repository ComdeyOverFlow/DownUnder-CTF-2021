# Solution

I am just playing around the website And i found (/robots.txt) that leads to another web path called (/sad.eml)

When I go to it, i got (.eml) email file

I looked into the email file.

I knew the email is send to sadcowboys@gmail.com. And i noticed the letters in the line of 18,

said that "thats why a 'sadcowboy' is only allowed to go into our website". 

So i knew that username is sadcowboy.

But i can't find the password, so i just testing some default passwords and  i got one idea that why i don't try sql injection in password field.

So I used (sadcowboy) for username and for password i used (' or 1=1 --).

Well, you can tell that i am lucky because in my first try with sql injection, It worked! Perfect!
